Design Goals
------------
50,000 IPs every minute

To Run:
-------
```go run main.go```
code assumes input file is a list of ips seperated by break lines

To Test:
--------
```go test```

Next steps:
-----------
ip parsing
getting a list of 5000 ips

app currently assumes that list of ips will fit into memory
added the linux environment variable you need to change
currently the code assumes all ips read from input files are ipv4
